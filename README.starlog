Starlog:

We would like to keep track of information concerning star formation
events.  Much of this information is not needed for the simulation,
but only for analysis.  Hence we record the star formation information
in a separate XDR file.  At the start of the file is an XDR int
containing the length of each record in bytes.  This also serves as a
"magic number".

The format of each record of the file will be:

iOrderStar, iOrderGas, timeform, rform[3], vform[3], massForm, rhoform, Tempform

The iOrders are int's and the rest of the values are DOUBLE's.

These records will be appended to the starlog file on a periodic basis
in order to reduce the amount of I/O.  By default we do this
everytime we do an output or a checkpoint.

Events will be accumulated on each processor in a buffer, which will
be flushed to disk (serially) and reset at the above intervals.

A record will be made in stfmFormStars(), except for the iOrderStar.
iOrderStar will be set in pkdNewOrder().
